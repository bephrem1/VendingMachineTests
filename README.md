# VendingMachineTests
JUnit Unit Testing Practice (TeamTreehouse Project)

Instructor/Code: Craig Dennis 

Explanation: A simple vending machine program used to practice unit testing on

My Additions: I heavily commented the test classes with best practices I learned and
discovered for running efficient unit tests using the JUnit framework

Comments: It never hit me how important it is to test your code and all of the ways that
it could break. For any real project I make with scale in the future test driven development
will definitely be in the front of my mind
